# Flatiron Lead Instructor Project: The Brochure Site

## Introduction

The "brochure site" is a rite of passage for all web developers. Back in the
late-nineties, when some of us got started writing HTML, brochure sites were all
there was. It was a lot of this: "Hi my name is Joe Flatiron and I'm a senior
in high school. I love [The Beatles][beatles] and the [Fugees][]. I'm on the
web!" Needless to say, things have gotten a lot prettier and a lot more
complicated since then!

Role-playing as a "brochure site consultant", make a site (or show us one of your projects) that fits the following requirements.

## Requirements

Yours or your clients' needs will be expressed _declaratively_ versus _imperatively_. People will tell you "Bring me a turkey
sandwich" not "Go to the kitchen. Take out bread, two slices, cheese (preferably
Irish Cheddar), etc." Similarly, we will present to you these requirements
_declaratively_. You must meet these _human-oriented_ targets, the techniques
and code will be _up to you to resolve_.

1. Your site must use HTML5 semantic elements for collecting content e.g.
   `<header>` and `<aside>`
2. Your site must use one of these layouts: multicolumn with floats, `flexbox`,
or CSS grid
3. Your site must be optimized for _at least_ 2 viewports (a full-screen device as well as a mobile device of choice)
4. You must enable some type of _dynamic_ interaction through Javascript. Perhaps this takes shape as a form with dynamic feedback, or an animation that responds to some event. Or, perhaps, a view that updates based on some user interaction. Be creative!

These are baseline requirements. As your creativity calls for expansion of
these ideas, follow it.

## Not Specified

1. **The subject matter**. While we'd love for you to post a page about how
   great programming is, the creativity of the Web's possibility is why so many
   of us have made it our vocation. Here are a few starter ideas:
   - a (r&eacute;sum&eacute;-like) or a hobby page ("Why [Sachin Tendulkar][ST]
   is the Greatest Sportsman of 3 generations")
   - a music page ("My list of [Phish][] Recordings with Audio Samples"). This
   can be something that will open a promotion discussion or which establishes
   your _bona fides_
2. **The Number of pages**. The goal of web design is to serve the content. If
   multiple pages does this best, great. Google has become a multi-billion
   dollar company with the most deceptively simple landing page in history.
   Serve your page with user experience in mind.

## Inspiration

Graphic design encompasses a wide variety of visual aesthetics. You might
choose one style over another. Try looking at the works of Jan Tschichold, Ettore Sottsass, Piet Zwart, László Moholy-Nagy, Josef Muller-Brockman, Henryk Berlewi, Khoi Vinh. While, a decade ago, it was inconceivable or incredibly
time-intensive to print-styled pages on the web, we now have technology that makes this possible. See if you can find ideas to make your page come to life!
